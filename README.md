# Detection-Covid-vs-Pneuomia-vs-Normal-X-rays
This is a project for the classification of X-rays Covid vs Pneuomia and Normal X-rays

If you want this specific data you can ask me for them. But you can find the data in https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset for Covid images, and https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data for Pneumonia and normal images.
